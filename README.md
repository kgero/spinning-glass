Spinning Glass Calc / Sim
=========================

The goal of this project is to create a tool for solving the following problem:

You have a glass of water on revolving tray, such as a lazy Susan. The tray slowly
begins to rotate. As the tray rotates faster and faster, what happens first?
1. The glass slides off the tray
2. The glass tips over
3. The water in the glass is flung out of the glass (without the glass falling over)
